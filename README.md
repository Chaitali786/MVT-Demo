Django - Model-View-Template 

Add a new model called User. It should have these fields:
First Name
Last Name
Email
 
Create a script that will populate your database with fake Users.
Confirm the populating through the Admin interface.
Create a view for your website for the domain extension /users
This /users page will be an HTML list of the user names and emails.
You will use template tags to generate this content from the User model.
Remember to change your urls.py files to deal with the changes to the /users extension!
